# pretty-mode-plus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akatov/pretty-mode-plus.png)](https://travis-ci.org/akatov/pretty-mode-plus)

Redisplay parts of the Emacs buffer as pretty symbols.

Arthur Danskin <arthurdanskin@gmail.com> released the excellent pretty-mode which fontifies various symbols here: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pretty-mode.el

My addition was to add support for some Lispy stuff, Unicode character documentation, and Unicode source references.
